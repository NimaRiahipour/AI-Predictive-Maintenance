# AI-Predictive-Maintenance
Machine learning project for predictive maintenance, focusing on anomaly detection and failure prediction to reduce downtime and costs

# AI-based Predictive Maintenance

A machine learning project designed to predict equipment failures using sensor data.  
This helps reduce downtime, optimize maintenance schedules, and save costs in industrial environments.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Machine Learning models: Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Networks
- Visualization of sensor trends and model performance
- Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

## Dataset
- NASA Turbofan Engine Degradation Dataset (publicly available)
- Includes multiple sensor readings per equipment over time

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/NiMa.Riahipour/AI-Predictive-Maintenance.git
cd AI-Predictive-Maintenance
pip install -r requirements.txt
